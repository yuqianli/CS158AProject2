To DO List: 
-----------
For part b(i)
-------------
-1) convert time time to milliseconds so litle on we can use that to calculate average RTT and other measurements.
-2) need to figure how to send a one-byte message (1Kbyte, 4KB, 8 KB, 16KB, 32 KB, and 64KB for part b(iii).
- 3) That's all i can think off for part b(i) now. Maybe there is some bugs or off by one errors..
